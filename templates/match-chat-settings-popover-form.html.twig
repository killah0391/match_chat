{# templates/match-chat-settings-popover-form.html.twig #}
{#
  This template is for the 'match_chat_settings_popover_form' theme hook.
  The $form variable contains the render array for the ChatSettingsPopoverForm.
  The form's #prefix and #suffix defined in buildForm() will create the
  outer wrapper div (e.g., id="chat-settings-popover-form-wrapper-{{TID}}").
  This template controls what goes *inside* that wrapper if it's not just {{ children }}.

{#
  Option 1: Simplest way if you just want to render all elements Drupal provides.
  Drupal's default form rendering also adds the <form> tag, CSRF tokens, form_id, etc.
  The #prefix and #suffix on the $form array in PHP will wrap this content.
#}
{# {{ form }} #}
{# This would render everything, including the form tag again if not careful #}

{#
  Option 2: More explicit rendering of your elements.
  This is useful if you want to add specific Bootstrap wrappers like form-switch.
  The main <form> tag and its necessary hidden fields (form_build_id, form_id, op)
  are usually handled by the parent form rendering process when 'render element' => 'form'.
  This template would be effectively overriding the 'children' part of a standard form.html.twig.
#}

{# Render the "Allow File Uploads" checkbox #}
<div
	class="form-check form-switch">
	{# Bootstrap 5 switch styling #}
	{{ form.allow_uploads.label_attributes.addClass('form-check-label') }}
	{{ form.allow_uploads.attributes.addClass('form-check-input') }}
	{{ form.allow_uploads }}
</div>

{#
  It's crucial to render any other elements Drupal expects, especially hidden fields,
  and elements added by Drupal like form_build_id, form_id, and form_token.
  The |without filter helps render everything else that you haven't explicitly rendered.
#}
{{ form|without('allow_uploads') }}
